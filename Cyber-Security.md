# Security Concepts:

## 1. Security Principles:

Understand the security concepts of information assurance:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Authentication (e.g., methods of authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA))
- Non-repudiation
- Privacy

## 2. Risk management, Business Continuity (BC), Disaster Recovery (DR) & Incident Response Concepts:

**a) Understand the risk management process:**
- Who are the threat actors?
   - Insiders, outsiders, formal entities like competitors/cybercriminals, political such aas terrorists/hacktivists,
         intelligence or information gatherers,technology eg bots.
   - Risk management (e.g., risk priorities, risk tolerance)
   - Risk identification,
   - Risk assessment
   - Risk treatment - accept,avoid,reduce or transfer
     
**b) Understand business continuity (BC), DR, IR:**
- Purpose
- Importance
- Components

## 3. Security and Access Controls Concepts:**

### a) Understand physical access controls:
- Physical security controls (e.g., badge systems, gate entry, environmental design)
- Monitoring (e.g., security guards, closed-circuit television (CCTV), alarm systems, logs)
- Authorized versus unauthorized personnel

### b) Understand logical or technical access controls:

- Principle of least privilege
- Segregation of duties
- Discretionary access control (DAC)
- Mandatory access control (MAC)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### c) Understand administrative controls: This falls under governance

- **Regulations and laws:**  issued by the government or governing authorities
- **Standards:**  This are industry standards like NIST,IEEE
- **Policies:**  drafted by institutions or company leadership.
- **Procedures:**  Company internal documentation on the how to implement specific tasks.

## 4. Network Security:

**a) Understand computer networking:**
- Networks (e.g., Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), WiFi)
- Ports
- Applications

**b) Understand network threats and attacks:**
- Types of threats (e.g., distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), virus, worm, Trojan, man-in-the-middle (MITM), side-channel)
- Identification (e.g., intrusion detection system (IDS), host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS), network intrusion detection system (NIDS))
- Prevention (e.g., antivirus, scans, firewalls, intrusion prevention system (IPS))

**c) Understand network security infrastructure:**
- On-premises (e.g., power, data center/closets, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), environmental, fire suppression, redundancy,
      memorandum of understanding (MOU)/memorandum of agreement (MOA))
- Design (e.g., network segmentation (demilitarized zone (DMZ), virtual local area network (VLAN), virtual private network (VPN), micro-segmentation),
      defense in depth, Network Access Control (NAC) (segmentation for embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT))
- Cloud (e.g., service-level agreement (SLA), managed service provider (MSP), Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), hybrid)

## 5. Operation Security:
**a) Understand data security:**
- Encryption (e.g., symmetric, asymmetric, hashing)
- Data handling (e.g., destruction, retention, classification, labeling)
- Logging and monitoring security events

**b) Understand system hardening:**
- Configuration management (e.g., baselines, updates, patches)

**c) Understand best practice security policies:**
- Data handling policy
- Password policy
- Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
- Bring your own device (BYOD) policy
- Change management policy (e.g., documentation, approval, rollback)
- Privacy policy

**d) Understand security awareness training:**
- Purpose/concepts (e.g., social engineering, password protection)
- Importance
